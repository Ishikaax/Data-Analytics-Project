# Data-Analytics-Project
In this project, we perform an end-to-end data analytics pipeline using Python and SQL. The workflow starts by utilizing the Kaggle API to automatically download the dataset. The data is then processed and cleaned using pandas to ensure its quality and consistency. Afterward, the cleaned data is loaded into an SQL Server database.

Once the data is loaded, we perform analysis by writing SQL queries to answer a series of insightful questions related to the dataset, demonstrating the power of SQL for extracting meaningful information from structured data.

This project showcases the integration of Python for data handling and SQL for analytical querying.
